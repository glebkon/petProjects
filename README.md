Implementation of a programmable questionnaire, in which the order and list of questions depend on the passed configuration in JSON format.
The questions in the questionnaire are dynamically determined based on the user's answers - the next question depends on the answer to the previous one.
To test the operation of the questionnaire, a script was created that works with the questionnaire logic code and passing through all possible ways of surveys.
