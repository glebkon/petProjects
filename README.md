# User Authentication using JWT
Built a REST API using ExpressJS for user authentication using JWT.  

Key steps include:  
Created an Express server to service requests from clients.  
Created controller, service, DAO and route layers for the users.  
Created controller, service, route layers for authentication.  
Modularized the routing process by declaring all the routes in the index.js file for users and authentication.  
The authentication middleware contains code to verify the token, so the user is authenticated to log in to the application. Created an error middleware.
